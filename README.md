# PHP Library Management System

The PHP Library Management System is a web application built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. It is designed to manage a library's collection, allowing users to perform various tasks such as book borrowing, returning, and cataloging. The system incorporates essential features such as authentication, authorization, file upload security against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Ensure secure access to the system with user authentication. Users must provide valid credentials to log in and access the features and functionalities of the library management system.

- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control to restrict user actions based on their roles and permissions. Different user roles, such as admin, librarian, and member, may have different levels of access and privileges within the system.

- **File Upload Security**: Implement security measures to protect against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities when handling file uploads. This includes validating file types, restricting file sizes, and implementing server-side checks to prevent malicious file uploads.

- **CRUD Operations**: Provide CRUD functionality to manage library resources. This allows users to create, read, update, and delete books, members, and other library-related entities through intuitive user interfaces.

- **Book Borrowing and Returning**: Enable users to borrow and return books from the library collection. The system tracks due dates, manages borrowing limits, and sends notifications for overdue books.

- **Cataloging and Searching**: Facilitate the cataloging of books in the library and provide search capabilities for users to find books based on various criteria such as title, author, genre, or ISBN.

- **User Management**: Allow administrators to manage user accounts, including creating new accounts, resetting passwords, and updating user information.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate reports and statistics about book availability, borrowing history, popular genres, and other relevant library metrics to assist in decision-making and resource planning.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML and CSS**: The application's frontend is built using HTML for structuring the web pages and CSS for styling and layout design.

- **PHP**: The server-side logic is implemented using PHP, which handles user authentication, authorization, data processing, and interaction with the MySQL database.

- **MySQL**: The MySQL database is used to store library-related data such as books, members, user accounts, and borrowing history.
